# Taskbook
## Software Engineering Course Project


This project was created for the purpose of the software engineering class we are taking at Walsh University.  The software has a calendar that you can put tasks into and a task view that will read that calendar to show you what you have to do today in a focused format.  The user interface is also customizable.
